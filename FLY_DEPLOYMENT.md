# Deploy with Fly.io (Easiest Docker Compose Option)

## Why Fly.io is Perfect for You
- **Native Docker Compose support** - just run `fly launch` and it converts automatically
- **Free tier**: 3 shared VMs, 160GB bandwidth/month
- **Simple setup**: One command deployment
- **Much easier than Railway**

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Fly CLI
```bash
# Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Or with Homebrew
brew install flyctl
```

### 2. Login and Deploy
```bash
# Login to Fly.io
fly auth login

# Launch your app (this will convert docker-compose.yml automatically!)
fly launch

# Deploy
fly deploy
```

That's it! Fly.io will automatically:
- Convert your `docker-compose.yml` to `fly.toml`
- Set up networking between services
- Deploy all services together

## Alternative: MongoDB Atlas + Render

If you prefer a managed database:

### 1. Set up MongoDB Atlas (Free)
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Create free account (512MB free tier)
3. Create cluster and get connection string

### 2. Deploy to Render
```bash
# Just push to GitHub and connect to Render
# Render will use the render.yaml I created for you
```

## Recommendation: Try Fly.io First

Fly.io is the easiest because:
1. **One command**: `fly launch` converts your Docker Compose automatically
2. **No configuration needed**: Works with your existing setup
3. **Free tier**: Perfect for your needs
4. **Simple**: Much less complex than Railway

## Cost Comparison (Free Tiers)
- **Fly.io**: 3 VMs free (perfect for your 3 services)
- **Render**: 750 hours/month per service (more than enough)
- **Railway**: $5 credit/month (ran into complexity issues)

## Next Steps
1. Try Fly.io first (easiest)
2. If you need more control, use Render
3. Railway is overkill for your use case
